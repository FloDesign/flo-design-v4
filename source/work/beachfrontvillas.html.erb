				<p>When you're appealing to a luxury, high end market that can afford to spend upto $20,000 USD per night on a villa in the Caribbean, it's important that your web site looks and feels just as high end and luxurious. We had a clean sheet of paper with which to approach the design and through a mix of classic &amp; contempary typography, a fresh, vibrant colour pallet and gorgeous photography we delivered a site that looks just as stunning as its subject matter. Couple that with the user experience and information architecture work we conducted, you end up with a site that's easy to use and looks stunning. Form and function in perfect harmony.</p>

				<p>Beach Front Villas is based on the excellent Roots <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock/">Bedrock</a> framework. This gives us a flexible development environment in addition to seperation of Wordpress core files and our custom theme for production. Use of Composer allows us to control plugin and Wordpress versions easily. The site had a requirement to be able to manage bookings for each villa and present available villas to a user based on a start and end date. We wrote a custom search plugin to grab available villas based on a custom booking post type attached to each villa. These results were then presented to the user so they could see exactly which villas were available on the dates provided.</p>
