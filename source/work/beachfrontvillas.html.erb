				<p>Taking our lead from GeoSLAM's vibrant orange and black branding we produced a striking design that incorporated some of the fantastic 3D point cloud imagery generated from their scanning products. The design is responsive and optimised to work across desktop, tablet and mobile devices so users get a great experience no matter how they access the site.</p>

				<p>Beachfront Villas is based on the excellent Roots <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock/">Bedrock</a> framework. This gives us a flexible development environment in addition to seperation of Wordpress core files and our custom theme for production. Use of Composer allows us to control plugin and Wordpress versions easily. The site had a requirement to be able to manage bookings for each villa and present available villas to a user based on a start and end date. We wrote a custom search plugin to grab available villas based on a custom booking post type attached to each villa. These results were then presented to the user so they could see exactly which villas were available on the dates provided.</p>
