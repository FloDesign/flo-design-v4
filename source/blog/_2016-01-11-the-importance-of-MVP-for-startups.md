You have a great idea for a startup and a bagful of VC cash. Your notebook is full of features that need implementing but do they all need to be done at once? Without data to back up your assumptions, you could be throwing away money.

Users rarely know what they want. What they understand best is the problem and not the solution. After all, if the solution was obvious then they would likely have implemented it already.

Startup founders usually also have a good idea of the problem. Perhaps they face it themselves and want to produce a solution, which would benefit not only themselves but also the community. However, the problems are often nuanced and unique for each user. How do you go about producing something which is the best fit for the majority facing that particular challenge? The answer is to use data.
