Icons are a great way of communicating information quickly and efficiently in a small amount of screen real estate and better yet they’re language independent. In an ideal world we’d spend time crafting and designing custom iconography for each project we do but a lot of the time budgetry and time constraints make this impossible. Fortunately there are plenty of great high quality sets available for free but it can be a chore to sift through them all right one in the correct format for your needs. Do you need am icon font? svgs? pngs? all of the above? Do you need social media icons as part of the set?

Luckily for you I’ve put together this handy list of sets that we  regularly call up on during our web design and web app projects.

Handily I’ve listed them with info on what format they come in, how many icons come in the set and if the whole set is free or just a sub set and I’ve tagged them with appropriate categories. Enjoy!

Streamline is a massive set of 4,000 icons spanning 97 categories. They offer a sub set of 100 icons for free but its definitely worth splashing out for one of the premium packs. What ever your icon need Streamline will have you covered.
