Icons are a great way of communicating information quickly and efficiently in a small amount of screen real estate and better yet they’re language independent. In an ideal world we’d spend time crafting and designing custom iconography for each project we do but a lot of the time and budget constraints make this impossible. Fortunately there are plenty of great high quality sets available but it can be a chore to sift through them all to find right one for your needs. Do you need an icon font? svgs? pngs? all of the above? Do you need social media icons as part of the set? Do you need them to scale?

Luckily for you I’ve put together this handy list of sets that we regularly call upon during our web design and web app projects.

I’ve listed them with info on what format they come in, how many icons come in the set and if the whole set is free or just a sub set. Enjoy! 

## [Streamline Icons](http://www.streamlineicons.com/)
