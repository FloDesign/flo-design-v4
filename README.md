# FloDesign website v4

Code for the FloDesign website found over at [flodesign.co.uk](http://flodesign.co.uk)

The site is powered by [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) and has been open-sourced to help anyone interested having a pre-built project to play with to get used to Middleman.

## Usage

Ensure you have Ruby and RubyGems installed.

Install the relevant dependancies by running:

```
bundle install
```

Edit the source to your heart's content and then perform a build:

```
middleman build

OR (if you have conflicting dependancy versions)

bundle exec middleman build
```
You can also test locally using Middleman's inbuilt server:

```
middleman
```
